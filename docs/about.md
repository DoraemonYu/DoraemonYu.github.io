## About Me

![my picture](/assets/img/me.jpg)

o(∩_∩)o Hello. My name is Doraemon Yu. 

I come from China, a senior software engineer with {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 2005 }} years development experience and {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 2011 }} years work experience.  
Simultaneously, I am MCSD (certified by Microsoft) and System-Architect (certified by government agency).  

In my spare time, in addition to development, I like to read English story books, flowers, traveling and scientific research. By the way, as my enlish name, I am a fan of Doraemon ~\\(≧▽≦)/~
