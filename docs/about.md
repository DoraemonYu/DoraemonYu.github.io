o(∩_∩)o Hello. My name is Yangzhou Yu. You can call me by my nickname, Doraemon. 

I come from China, and I am a senior software engineer with {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 2005 }} years development experience and {{ site.time | date: '%Y' | minus: 2011 }} years work experience.  
Furthermore, I am a MCSD (certified by Microsoft) and System-Architect (certified by government agency).  

In my leisure time, I love to read books on science and art, sometimes play piano alone, and sometimes travel with my friends. BTW, my nickname as you see, I am a fan of Doraemon ~\\(≧▽≦)/~

幻蓝工作室 is my personal studio, which is nonprofit purposes.  

Now it mainly produce the free softwares that was written from me, offer some funny and useful public IT services, etc.

The studio was founded in 1999, when I was primary school students, the initial output was handmade, Later, gradually, the output was IT-related content.  =￣ω￣= As you see, I likes to imagine and create when I was a child , so over the years, the studio has witnessed my growth.
